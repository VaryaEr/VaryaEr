## Hi there 👋 I'm Varvara ✨

I've been building web apps for 5+ years, from corporate portals to high‑load e‑commerce with 250k+ monthly users.  
**Senior Frontend Developer** specializing in **Vue**, **Nuxt**, and **TypeScript**. I'm that person who gets excited about clean architecture, smooth migrations, and making life easier for both users and developers.

**What I do best:**
- 🏛️ Design frontend architecture that doesn't fall apart in a year
- 🚀 Make things fast (Lighthouse 94, LCP 1.8s — yes please)
- 👩‍🏫 Mentor juniors and help teams level up
- 🧠 Know my way around legacy code

**Currently:** Deep in Nuxt 3/4, Stripe integrations, Leading frontend team, and teaching people how to write better Vue
